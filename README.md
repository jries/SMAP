Requirements
------------

1.  MATLAB 2019a and newer. Toolboxes: Optimization, Image processing,
    Curve fitting, Statistics and Machine Learning.
    A fully functional stand-alone version that does not require a MATLAB
    license but is limited in extendability can be downloaded from https://www.embl.de/download/ries/SMAPCompiled/ (Installation notes see below).

2.  Mac or Windows

3.  For GPU fitting: Windows, NVIDIA graphics card. CUDA driver
    (recommended: version 7.5). All fitters also come with a CPU version
    that is used when these specifications are not met.

Installation
------------

1.  Clone git repository:

    a.  Use Terminal (MacOS) or Cmd (Win). Use cd to navigate to the
        target directory. (e.g. cd git)

    b.  Type: `git clone https://github.com/jries/SMAP` and type
        in your username and password for your git account.

2.  Install Micromanager 1.4.22 from https://micro-manager.org

3.  If needed install www.openmicroscopy.org/bio-formats/downloads

4.  In MATLAB: run SMAP.m, if questioned, change folder.

5.  In the Menu select SMAP/Preferences... Switch to the Directories tab
    and select the directories of Micro-Manager and of the
    bioformats\_package.jar. Press **Save and exit**.

Typical install times: 15 minutes.

Installation of stand-alone version
------------

1.  Download the respective version from https://www.embl.de/download/ries/SMAPCompiled/ corresponding to your operating system.
2.  Follow the installation notes in Installation_notes_SMAP_compiled.rtf which can be found under the previous link.
