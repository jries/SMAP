Fourier Ring Correlation (FRC) resolution based on the matlab code provided with: 

Nieuwenhuizen, Lidke, Bates, Puig, Grunwald, Stallinga, and Rieger, 
Measuring image resolution in optical nanoscopy., Nat Methods, 10 (2013).

The idea is to compare two independent images of the same sample. Real structures will appear
in both images, whereas noise will be independent and thus not appear correlated in both images.

This allows extraction of a direct resolution measure independent on relying on camera calibration or fitting routines. This resolution 
not only depends on the localization precision, but also e.g. on the labeling density.

In SMLM, independent images can be constructed from sub-sets of the data. For example, one can divide
the data into N blocks and reconstruct image 1 from the even and image 2 from uneven block numbers.

The images are compared cross-correlation, which in Fourier space becomes a multiplication. The correlation
is calculated for rings of differnt radius in Fourier space, corresponding to different spatial frequencies. This
allows plotting the correlation signal vs the spatial freuqency.

Finally, a threshold value (typically 0.17 of the maximum of the correlation curve) identifies the maximum spatial frequency that 
still shows a correlation.

Note that here corrections for multiple activations are not integrated. Thus, for fluorophores that can be
re-activated sevaral times and thus appear in many blocks, the single-molecule peak also contributes to the
FRC resolution, not only structural details.

The FRC curve is defined as:

$$ FRC(q)=\frac{\sum_{\vec{q} \in \textrm{circle}} \hat{f_1}(\vec{q})\hat{f_2}(\vec{q})^*}{\sqrt{\sum_{\vec{q} \in \textrm{circle}} \left|\hat{f_1}(\vec{q})\right|^2} \sqrt{\sum_{\vec{q} \in \textrm{circle}} \left|\hat{f_2}(\vec{q})\right|^2}} $$

Here $\vec{q}$ is the spatial frequency and $\hat{f_1}$ and $\hat{f_2}$ are the Fourier transforms of image 1 and image 2, respectively.



gui:Parameters:
gui:blockassignment How blocks are assigned to the two images. Alteranting or Random.
gui:frc_blocks Numer of blocks to calculate the two images.
gui:pixrec_frc Pixel size of the reconstructed images 1 and 2 used for FRC 
gui:t0 
gui:t2=pixrec_frc 
gui:t3 
gui:t4=frc_blocks 
gui:takeimage If checked, the pixel size of the current rendering is used. Othwerwise you can specify
the pixel size. It should be several times smaller than the FRC resolution.
gui:fsc_3D If checked, calculate the Fourier shell correlation instead of FRC, this can take a lot of memory
