# Getting started
LocMoFit composites a set of classes and functions. You can download them [here] (https://github.com/jries/SMAP/tree/develop/LocMoFit)

## Requirements
1. MATLAB 2020b and newer. Toolboxes: Optimization, Image processing, Curve fitting, Statistics, Machine Learning, and Global optimization. 
	:::{Note}
	LocMoFit will be integrated to SMAP as a part of its fully functional stand-alone version that does not require a MATLAB license but is limited in extendibility. The stand-alone version of SMAP can be downloaded from [here](https://www.embl.de/download/ries/SMAPCompiled/). Installation notes can be downloaded [here](https://www.embl.de/download/ries/SMAPCompiled/Installation_notes_SMAP_compiled.rtf).
	:::
2. Mac or Windows.
3. SMAP is optional but highly recommended.

## Installation
### With SMAP
You can access to LocMoFit by installing SMAP. Check section _Installation_ for [SMAP](https://github.com/jries/SMAP/) on GitHub.

### Stand-alone
You can downloaded the zipped files of LocMoFit [here](https://www.embl.de/download/ries/LocMoFit/). To install the code, simply just unzip (usually in less than 5 min) the file and add the path of the unzipped folder to MATLAB.
