LocMoFit
========

Overview
--------

LocMoFit (Localization Model Fit) is a model fitting software for SMLM data. It fits an arbitrary geometric model to the localization coordinates of a segmented structure. LocMoFit is described in the bioRxiv preprint Wu, Y.-L. et al. Maximum-likelihood model fitting for quantitative analysis of SMLM data. 2021.08.30.456756. *bioRxiv* (2021) doi:`10.1101/2021.08.30.456756. <https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2021.08.30.456756v1>`_
